## 🎭 Motivations

Although there's other (amazing!) alternatives that provide a zen-distraction-free-center mode, they usually make assumptions that might alter your workflow, or at least require some configuration to suit your needs.

`no-neck-pain.nvim` aims at providing a non-opinionated buffer centering experience, while being super customizable.
